# I, Chatbot

Welcome to I, Chatbot, a workshop all about building bots for Microsoft Teams and Sharepoint using the latest version of the Bot Framework.

These notes are intended as a companion for the workshop. Most of the slides are here; some text slides have been placed directly into the text of these notes. There is a markdown file for each section of the workshop as follows:

* [Part 1 - First Bot](./Notes/01-FirstBot.md)
* [Part 2 - QnA Maker](./Notes/02-QnAMaker.md)
* [Part 3 - Bot State](./Notes/03-State.md)
* [Part 4 - Dialogs](./Notes/04-Dialogs.md)
* [Part 5 - LUIS](./Notes/05-LUIS.md)
* [Part 6 - Adaptive Cards](./Notes/06-AdaptiveCards.md)
* [Part 7 - Calling back-end services](./Notes/07-CallingServices.md)

Some of the sections include challenges; many of these are for you to take home after the workshop, since it's not feasible to get everybody set up with the right tools and subscriptions. A few of the challenges require just a web browser, and can be completed during the workshop as time permits.
