### Eliza

[Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) may be best known for cracking the Enigma machine, a cryptographic device used by Germany during World War II. In 1950, Turing proposed what is now called the Turing Test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior. If a human evaluator is unable to distinguish natural language conversations with those of the machine and those of a human, the test is passed.

In 1966, [Joseph Weizenbaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weizenbaum) completed [Eliza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA), a program intended to pass the Turing Test. The most famous script, “Doctor”, simulated a Rogerian psychotherapist, based on the work of Carl Rogers who was well known for parroting back to patients whatever they had just said. In 2005, Norbert Lansteiner ported [Eliza to JavaScript](https://www.masswerk.at/elizabot/).

CHALLENGE
---------

There is a copy of Eliza in Plunker, ready for you to play with! (Plunker is a JavaScript playground that runs in any modern web browser).


Your challenge is to run the plunk at [http://bit.ly/ElizaPlunk](http://bit.ly/ElizaPlunk) and:

1. Run Eliza and decide if you think it passes the Turing Test
2. Modernize Eliza by adding SharePoint to all references to dreams and dreaming
